# User Behavior Prediction System

## Project Description
This project predicts user behavior using machine learning techniques.
It is based on user demographic and activity data such as age, gender,
platform usage, income, and interests.

The project includes data cleaning, feature encoding, scaling, and
machine learning model training.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset
Files used:
- datset.csv
- cleandata.csv
- finaldataset.csv

The dataset contains:
- Age
- Gender
- Platform
- Interests
- Location
- Profession
- Income
- Home ownership
- Time spent

## Project Workflow
1. Load raw dataset
2. Handle missing values
3. Encode categorical features
4. Scale numerical features
5. Prepare final dataset
6. Train ML model
7. Evaluate accuracy

## Algorithms Used
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest (optional)
